First of all, I should state that in the year 1909 I accompanied the Honorable Japanese Commercial Commissioners in their visit to the various American capitals and other cities of the United states, where we were met with the heartiest welcome, and for which we all felt the most profound gratitude.  We were all so happy, but I was especially so; indeed, it would be impossible to be more happy than I felt, and particularly was this true of one day, namely, the twenty-seventh of November of the year named, when Henry P. Bowie, Esq., invited us to his residence in San Mateo, where we found erected by him a Memorial Gate to commemorate our victories in the Japanese-Russian War; and its dedication had been reserved for this day of our visit.  Suspended above the portals was a bronze tablet inscribed with letters written by my late father, Ichi Roku.  The evening of that same day we were invited by our host to a reception extended to us in San Francisco by the Japan Society of America, where I had the honor of delivering a short address on Japanese folk-lore.  In adjoining halls was exhibited a large collection of Japanese writings and paintings, the latter chiefly the work of the artist, Kubota Beisen, while the writings were from the brush of my deceased father, between whom and Mr. Bowie there existed the relations of the warmest friendship and mutual esteem.
</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">
Two years or more have passed and I am now in receipt of information from Mr. Shimada Sekko that Mr. Bowie is about to publish a work upon the laws of Japanese painting and I am requested to write a preface to the same.  I am well aware how unfitted I am for such an undertaking, but in view of all I have here related I feel I am not permitted to refuse.
</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">
Indeed, it seems to me that the art of our country has for many years past been introduced to the public of Europe and America in all sorts of ways, and hundreds of books about Japanese art have appeared in several foreign languages; but I have been privately alarmed for the reason that a great many such books contain either superficial observations made during sightseeing sojourns of six months or a year in our country or are but hasty commentaries, compilations, extracts or references, chosen here and there from other
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><span style="font-style: italic">
 volumes.  All work of this kind must be considered extremely superficial.  But Mr. Bowie has resided many years in Japan.  He thoroughly understands our institutions and national life; he is accustomed to our ways, and is fully conversant with our language and literature, and he understands both our arts of writing and painting.  Indeed, I feel he knows about such matters more than many of my own countrymen; added to this, his taste is instinctively well adapted to the Oriental atmosphere of thought and is in harmony with Japanese ideals.  And it is he who is the author of the present volume.  To others a labor of the kind would be very great; to Mr. Bowie it is a work of no such difficulty, and it must surely prove a source of priceless instruction not only to Europeans and Americans, but to my own countrymen, who will learn not a little from it.  Ah, how fortunate do we feel it to be that such a book will appear in lands so far removed from our native shores.  Now that I learn that Mr. Bowie has written this book the happiness of two years ago is again renewed, and from this far-off country I offer him my warmest congratulations, with the confident hope that his work will prove fruitfully effective.

Seventeen years ago, at a time when China and Japan were crossing swords, Mr. Henry P. Bowie came to me in Kyoto requesting that I instruct him in the Japanese language and in the Chinese written characters.  I consented and began his instruction.  I was soon astonished by his extraordinary progress and could hardly believe his language and writing were not those of a native Japanese.  As for the Chinese written characters, we learn them only to know their meaning and are not accustomed to investigate their hidden significance; but Mr. Bowie went so thoroughly into the analysis of their forms, strokes and pictorial values that his knowledge of the same often astounded and silenced my own countrymen.  In addition to this, having undertaken to study Japanese painting, he placed himself under one of our most celebrated artists and, daily working with unabated zeal, in a comparatively short time made marvelous progress in that art.  At one of our public art expositions he exhibited a painting of pigeons flying across a bamboo grove which was greatly admired and praised by everyone, but no one could believe that this was the work of a foreigner.  At the conclusion of the exposition he was awarded a diploma attesting his merit.  Many were the persons who coveted the painting, but as it had been originally offered to me, I still possess it.  From time to time I refresh my eyes with the work and with much pleasure exhibit it to my friends.  Frequently after this Mr. Bowie, always engaged in painting remarkable pictures in the Japanese manner, would exhibit them at the various art exhibitions of Japan, and was on two occasions specially honored by our Emperor and Empress, both of whom expressed the wish to possess his work, and Mr. Bowie had the honor of offering the same to our Imperial Majesties.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 1893 I went on a short visit to Japan, and becoming interested in much I saw there, the following year I made a second journey to
that country.  Taking up my residence in Kyoto, I determined to study and master, if possible, the Japanese language, in order to thoroughly understand the people, their institutions, and civilization.  My studies began at daybreak and lasted till midday.  The afternoons being unoccupied, it occurred to me that I might, with profit, look into the subject of Japanese painting.  The city of Kyoto has always been the hotbed of Japanese art.  At that time the great artist, Ko No Bairei, was still living there, and one of his distinguished pupils, Torei Nishigawa, was highly recommended to me as an art instructor. Bairei had declared Torei's ability was so great that at the age of eighteen he had learned all he could teach him.  Torei was now over thirty years of age and a perfect type of his kind, overflowing with skill, learning, and humor.  He gave me my first lesson and I was simply entranced.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was as though the skies had opened to disclose a new kingdom of art.  Taking his brush in hand, with a few strokes he had executed a masterpiece, a loquot <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(biwa)</span></span> branch, with leaves clustering round the ripe fruit.  Instinct with life and beauty, it seemed to have actually grown before my eyes.  From that moment dated my enthusiasm for Japanese painting.  I remained under Nishigawa for two years or more, working assiduously on my knees daily from noon till nightfall, painting on silk or paper spread out flat before me, according to the Japanese method.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Japanese painters are generally classed according to what they confine themselves to producing. Some are known as painters of figures <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(jim butsu)</span></em> or animals <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(do butsu)</span></em>, others as painters of landscapes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(san sui)</span></em>, others still as painters of flowers and birds <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ka cho)</span></em>, others as painters of religious subjects <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(butsu gwa),</span></em>  and so on.  Torei was a painter of flowers and birds, and these executed by him are really as beautiful as their prototypes in nature.  On <a href="#plate07" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">plate VII</span></a>  is given a specimen of his work.  He is now a leading artist of Osaka, where he has done much to revive painting in that commercial city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I desired to get some knowledge of Japanese landscape painting, I was fortunate in next obtaining instruction from the distinguished Kubota Beisen, one of the most popular and gifted artists in the empire.
</p>



<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In company with several of his friends and former pupils I called upon him.  After the usual words of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span>
ceremony he was asked if he would kindly paint something for our delight.  Without hesitation he spread a large sheet of Chinese paper <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(toshi)</span></em>
him and in a few moments we beheld a crow clinging to the branches of a persimmon tree and trying to peck at the fruit, which was just a trifle out of reach.  The work seemed that of a magician.  I begged him then and there to give me instruction.  He consented, and thus began an acquaintance and friendship which lasted until his death a few years ago. I worked faithfully under his guidance during five years, every day of the week, including Sundays.  I never tired; in fact, I never wanted to stop.  Every stroke of his brush seemed to have magic in it.  <a href="#plate04" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate IV.)</span></a> In many ways he was one of the cleverest artists Japan has ever produced.  He was an author as well as a painter, and wrote much on art.  At the summit of his renown he was stricken hopelessly blind and died of chagrin,—he could paint no more.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While living in Tokio for a number of years I painted constantly under two other artists—Shimada Sekko, now distinguished for fishes; and Shimada Bokusen, a pupil of Gaho, and noted for landscape in the Kano style; so that, after nine years in all of devotion and labor given to Japanese painting, I was able to get a fairly good understanding of its theory and practice.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may seem strange that one not an Oriental should become thus interested in Japanese painting and devote so much time and hard work to it; but the fact is, if one seriously investigates that art
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span>
he readily comes under the sway of its fascination.
As the people of Japan love art in all its manifestations, the foreigner who paints in their manner finds a double welcome among them; thus, ideal conditions are supplied under which the study there of art can be pursued.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My memory records nothing but kindness in that particular.  During my long residence in Kyoto there were constantly sent to me for my enjoyment and instruction precious paintings by the old masters, to be replaced after a short time by other works of the various schools.  For such attention I was largely indebted to the late Mr. Kumagai, one of Kyoto's most highly esteemed citizens and art patrons.  Without multiplying instances of the generous nature of the Japanese and their interest in the endeavors of a foreigner to study their art, I will mention the gift from the Abbot of Ikegami of two original dragon paintings, executed for that temple by Kano Tanyu.  In Tokio my dwelling was the frequent rendezvous of many of the leading artists of that city and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">gassaku</span></em> painting was invariably our principal pastime. The great poet, Fukuha Bisei, now gone, would frequently join us, and to every painting executed he would add the embellishment of his charming inspirations in verse, written thereon in his inimitable <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kana</span></span> script.  This nobleman had taught the art of poetry to H. I. M. Mutsu Hito, to the preceding Emperor, and to the present Crown Prince.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In approaching a brief exposition of the laws of Japanese painting it is not my purpose to claim for that art superiority over every other kind of painting; nor will I admit that it is inferior to other schools of painting.  Rather would I say that it is a waste of time to institute comparisons.  Let it be remembered only that no Japanese painting can be properly understood, much less appreciated, unless we possess some acquaintance with the laws which control its production.  Without such knowledge, criticism—praising or condemning a Japanese work of art—is without weight or value.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Japanese painters smile wearily when informed that foreigners consider their work to be flat, and at best merely decorative; that their pictures have no middle distance or perspective, and contain no shadows; in fact, that the art of painting in Japan is still in its infancy.  In answer to all this suffice it to say that whatever a Japanese painting fails to contain has been purposely omitted.  With Japanese artists it is a question of judgment and taste
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span>
as to what shall be painted and what best left out.  They never aim at photographic accuracy or distracting detail.  They paint what they feel rather than what they see, but they first see very distinctly.  It is the artistic impression <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sha i)</span></em>  which they strive to perpetuate in their work.  So far as perspective is concerned, in the great treatise of Chu Kaishu entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Poppy-Garden Art Conversations,”</span> a work laying down the fundamental laws of landscape painting, artists are specially warned against disregarding the principle of perspective called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">en kin,</span></em> meaning what is far and what is near.  The frontispiece to the present volume illustrates how cleverly perspective is produced in Japanese art <a href="#plate01" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate I).</span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Japanese artists are ardent lovers of nature; they closely observe her changing moods, and evolve every law of their art from such incessant, patient, and careful study.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These laws (in all there are seventy-two of them recognized as important) are a sealed book to the uninitiated.  I once requested a learned Japanese to translate and explain some art terms in a work on Japanese painting.  He frankly declared he could not do it, as he had never studied painting.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Japanese are unconsciously an art-loving people.  Their very education and surroundings tend to make them so. When the Japanese child of tender age first takes his little bowl of rice, a pair of tiny chop-sticks is put into his right hand.  He grasps them as we would a dirk.  His mother then shows him how he should manipulate them.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span>
He has taken a first lesson in the use of the brush.  With practice he becomes skilful, and one of his earliest pastimes is using the chop-sticks to pick up single grains of rice and other minute objects, which is no easy thing to do.  It requires great dexterity.
He is insensibly learning how to handle the double brush <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ni hon</span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">fude)</span></span> with which an artist will,
among other things, lay on color with one brush and dilute or shade off <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(kumadori)</span></span> the color with another, both brushes being held at the same time
in the same hand, but with different fingers.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the age of six the child is sent to school and taught to write with a brush the phonetic signs Japanese (forty-seven in number) which constitute the Japanese syllabary. These signs represent the forty-seven pure sounds of the Japanese language and are used for writing.  They are known as <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">katakana</span></span> and are simplified Chinese characters, consisting of two or three strokes each.  With them any word in Japanese can be written.  It takes a year for a child to learn all these signs and to write them from memory, but they are an excellent training for both the eye and the hand.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His next step in education is to learn to write these same sounds in a different script, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hiragana.</span></span> These characters are cursive or rounded in form, while the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">katakana</span></span> are more or less square. The <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hiragana</span></span> are more graceful and can be written more rapidly, but they are more complicated.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From daily practice considerable training in the use of the brush and the free movement of the right arm and wrist is secured, and the eye is taught
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span>
insensibly the many differences between the square and the cursive form.  Before the child is eight years old he has become quite skilful in writing with the brush both kinds of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kana.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He is next taught the easier Chinese characters,—Chinese <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">kanji</span></em>  and ideographs.  These are most ingeniously constructed and are of great importance in the further training of the eye and hand.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So greatly do these wonderfully conceived written forms appeal to the artistic sense that a taste for them thus early acquired leads many a Japanese scholar to devote his entire life to their study and cultivation.  Such writers become professionals and are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shoka.</span></em> Probably the most renowned in all China was Ogishi.  Japan has produced many such famous men, but none greater than Iwaya Ichi Roku, who has left an immortal name.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From what has been said about writing with the brush, it will be understood how the youth who may determine to follow art as a career is already well prepared for rapid strides therein.  His hand and arm have acquired great freedom of movement.  His eye has been trained to observe the varying lines and intricacies of the strokes and characters, and his sentiments of balance, of proportion, of accent and of stroke order, have been insensibly developed according to subtle principles, all aiming at artistic results.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The knowledge of Chinese characters and the their ability to write them properly are considered of prime importance in Japanese art.  A first counsel given me by Kubota Beisen was to commence that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span>
study, and he personally introduced me to Ichiroku who, from that time, kindly supervised my many years of work in Chinese writing, a pursuit truly engrossing and captivating.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all Japanese schools the rudiments of art are taught, and children are trained to perceive, feel, and enjoy what is beautiful in nature.  There is no city, village, or hamlet in all Japan that does not contain its plantations of plum and cherry blossoms in spring, its peonies and lotus ponds in summer, its chrysanthemums in autumn, and camelias, mountain roses and red berries in winter.  The school children are taken time and again to see these, and revel amongst them.  It is a part of their education.  Excursions, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">undokai,</span></em> are organized at stated intervals during the school term and the scholars gaily tramp to distant parts of the country, singing patriotic and other songs the while and enjoying the view of waterfalls, broad and winding rivers, autumn maples, or snow-capped mountains.  In addition to this, trips are taken to all famous temples and historical places including, where conveniently near, the three great views of Japan,—Matsushima, Ama No Hashi Date, and Myajima.  Thus a taste for landscape is inculcated and becomes second nature.  Furthermore, the scholars are encouraged to closely watch every form of life, including butterflies, crickets, beetles, birds, goldfish, shell-fish, and the like; and I have seen miniature landscape gardens made by Japanese children, most cleverly reproducing charming views
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span>
and contained in a shallow box or tray.  This gentle little art is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">bonsai</span></em> or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hako niwa.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My purpose in alluding to all this is to indicate that a boy on leaving school has absorbed already much artistic education and is fairly well equipped for beginning a special course in the art schools of the empire.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These schools differ in their methods of instruction,
and many changes have been introduced in
them during the present reign, or Meiji period, but
substantially the course takes from three to four
years and embraces copying (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">isha </span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">mitori</span></span>), tracing

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In copying, the teacher usually first paints the particular subject and the student reproduces it under his supervision. Kubota's invariable method was to require the pupil on the following day to reproduce from memory <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(an ki)</span></em> the subject thus copied. This engenders confidence.  In tracing, thin paper is placed over the picture and the outlines <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(rin kaku)</span></em> are traced according to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exact order</span></em> in which the original subject was executed, an order which is established by rule; thus a proper style and brush habit are acquired. The correct sequence of the lines and parts of a painting is of the highest importance to its artistic effect.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In reducing the size of what is studied, the laws of proportion are insensibly learned. This is of great use afterwards in sketching <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(shassei).</span></em> I believe that in the habit of reproducing, as taught in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span>
the schools, lies the secret of the extraordinary skill
of the Japanese artisan who can produce marvelous
effects in compressing scenery and other subjects course within the very smallest dimensions and yet preserve correct proportions and balance.  Nothing can excel in masterly reduction the miniature landscape work of the renowned Kaneiye, as exhibited in his priceless sword guards <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tsuba).</span></span>

Sketching comes later in the course and is taught only after facility has been acquired in the other three departments.

Kubota was so skilful in sketching that while traveling rapidly through a country he could faithfully reproduce the salient features of an extended landscape, conformable to the general rule in sketching, that what first attracts the eye is to be painted first, all else becoming subordinate to it in the scheme.  Again, he could paint the scenery and personages of any historical song <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(joruri)</span></span> as it was being sung to him, reproducing everything therein described and finishing his work in exact time with the last bar of the music.  His arm and wrist were so free and flexible that his brush skipped about with the velocity of a dragon-fly.  As an offhand painter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sekijo),</span></em> or as a contributor to an impromptu picture in which several artists will in turn participate,

The Kyoto painters have always been most gifted in that kind of accomplishment.  In their day Watanabe Nangaku, a pupil of Okyo, Bairei, and Hyakunen, all of Kyoto, were famous as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sekijo</span></em> painters.

The art student having completed his course is now qualified to attach himself to some of the great artists, into whose household he will be admitted and whose <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">deshi</span></span> or art disciple he becomes from that time on.  The relation between such master <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sensei)</span></em> and his pupil <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(deshi)</span></span> is the most kindly imaginable.  Indeed, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">deshi</span></span> is a very beautiful word, meaning a younger brother, and was first applied to the Buddhist disciples of Shakka.  The master treats him as one of his family and the pupil reveres the master as his divinity.  Greater mutual regard and affection exist nowhere and many pupils remain more or less attached to the master's household until his death.  To the most faithful and skilful of these the master bestows or bequeaths his name or a part of it, or his nom de plume <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(go);</span></em> and thus it is that the celebrated schools <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ryugi</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ha</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">fu)</span></em> of Japanese painting have been formed and perpetuated, beginning with Kanaoka, Tosa, Kano, and Okyo, and brought down to posterity through the devoted, and I might say sacred efforts of their pupils, to preserve the methods and traditions of those great men.  Pupils of the earlier painters took their masters' family names, which accounts for so many Tosas and Kanos.

Great painters have always been held in high esteem in Japan, not only by their pupils, but also by the whole nation.  Chikudo, the distinguished tiger painter, Bairei, one of the most renowned of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shijo ha</span></em> or Maruyama school, Hashimoto Gaho, a pupil of Kano Massano and a leading exponent of the Kano style (Kano <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ha),</span></em> and Katei, a Nangwa artist, all only recently deceased, were glorified in their lifetime.  Strange to say, no one ever saw Gaho with brush in hand.  He never would paint before his pupils or in any one's presence.  His instructions were oral.  On the other hand, Kubota Beisen was always at his best when painting before crowds of admirers.

To say a few words about the different schools of painting in Japan, there were great artists there, many centuries before Italy had produced Michael Angelo or Raphael.  The art of painting began more than fifteen hundred years ago and has continued in uninterrupted descent from that remote time down to this forty-fourth year of Meiji, the present emperor's reign.  No other country in the civilized world can produce such an art record.  One thousand years before America was discovered,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span>
five hundred years before England had a name, and long before civilization had any meaning in Europe, there were artists in Japan following the profession of painting with the same ardor and the same intelligence they are now bestowing upon their art in this twentieth century of our era.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Buddhism was introduced there in the
sixth century, a great school of Buddhist artists
began its long career.  Among  the names that
stand out from behind the mist of ages is that of
Kudara no Kawanari, who came from Corea.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the ninth century lived the celebrated Kose Kanaoka.  He painted in what was called the pure Japanese style, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">yamato e,</span></span> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">yamato</span></span> being the earliest name by which Japan was designated.  He painted portraits and landscapes, and his school having a great following, lasted through five centuries.  Kose Kimi Mochi, his pupil, Kimitada and Hirotaka were distinguished disciples of Kanaoka.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Tosa school came next, beginning with Tosa Motomitsu, followed by Mitsunaga, Nobuzane and Mitsunobu.  It dates back to the period of the Kamakura Shogunate eight hundred years ago.  Its artists confined themselves principally to painting court scenes, court nobles, and the various ceremonies of court life.  This school always used color in its paintings.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After Tosa came the schools of Sumiyoshi, Takuma, Kassuga, and Sesshu. Sesshu was a genius of towering proportions and an indefatigable artist of the very highest rank as a landscape painter.  He had a famous pupil named Sesson.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Following Sesshu came the celebrated school of Kano artists, founded in the sixteenth century by Kano Masanobu.  It took Japan captive.  It had a tremendous vogue and following, and has come down to the present day through a succession of great painters.  There were two branches, one in Edo (Tokyo), which included Kano Masanobu, Motonobu, his son, Eitoku, Motonobu's pupil, and later, Tanyu (Morinobu) Tanshin, his pupil, Koetsu, Naonobu, Tsunenobu, Morikage, Itcho, and finally Hashimoto Gaho, its latest distinguished representative, who is but recently deceased.  The other branch, known as the Kyoto Kano, included the famous San Raku, Eino, San Setsu, and others. By some critics San Raku is placed at the head of all the Kano artists.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Kano painters are remarkable for the boldness and living strength of the brush strokes <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(fude no chicara</span></span> or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">fude no ikioi)</span></span>, as well as for the brilliancy or sheen <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tsuya)</span></span> and shading of the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi.</span></span> This latter effect—the play of light and shade in the stroke, considered almost a divine gift—is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">bokushoku,</span></em> and recalls somewhat the term <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">chiaroscuru.</span></span> The range of subjects of the Kano painters was originally limited to classic Chinese scenery, treated with simplicity and refinement, and to Chinese personages, sages and philosophers; color was used sparingly.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other schools, more or less offshoots of the Kano style <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ryu)</span></em> of painting, came next—e. g., Korin and his imitator, Hoitsu, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">daimyo</span></em> of Sakai, who was said to use powdered gold and precious stones in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span>

Another disciple of the Kano school, and a pupil of Yutei, was Maruyama Okyo, who founded in turn a school of art which is the most widely spread and flourishing in Japan today.  Maruyama, not Okyo, was the family name of that artist.  The name Okyo originated thus: Maruyama, much admiring an ancient painter named Shun Kyo, took the latter half of that name, Kyo, and prefixing an <span class="tei tei-q">“O”</span> to it, made it Okyo, which he then adopted.  His style is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shi jo fu, shi jo</span></em> being the name of that part of Kyoto where he resided, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">fu</span></em> meaning style or manner, and its characteristic is artistic fidelity to the objects represented.  By some it is called the realistic school, and includes such well-known household names as Goshun, pupil of Busson, Sosen, the great monkey painter, Tessan <a href="#plate03" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate III.)</span></a> and his son, Morikwansai, Bairei, Chi-kudo, the tiger painter, Hyakunen and his three pupils, Keinen, Shonen and Beisen, Kawabata Gyokusho, Torei, Shoen, and Takeuchi Seiho.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are still other schools <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ryugi)</span></em> which might be mentioned, including that of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">nangwa,</span></em> or Chinese southern painters, of Chinese origin and remarkable for the gracefulness of the brush stroke, the effective treatment of the masses and for the play of light and shade throughout the composition. Among the great <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">nangwa</span></em> painters are Taigado, Chikuden, Baietsu <a href="#plate08" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate VIII)</span></a> and Katei.   To this school is referred a style of painting affected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span>
exclusively by the professional writers of Chinese characters, and called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">bunjingwa.</span></em> To these I will allude further on.  The versatile artist, Tani Buncho, created a school which had many adherents, including the distinguished Watanabe Kwazan and Eiko of Tokyo, lately deceased, one of its best exponents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The art of painting is enthusiastically pursued at the present time in Kyoto, Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.  In Tokyo, Hashi Moto Gaho was generally conceded to be, up to the time of his death in 1908, the foremost artist in Japan.  Although of the Kano school, he greatly admired European art, and the treatment of the human figure in some of his latest paintings recalls the manner of the early Flemish artists.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My first meeting with Gaho was at his home.  While waiting for him, I observed suspended in the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></span> or alcove, a narrow little <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> by Kano Moto Nobu, representing an old man upon a donkey crossing a bridge.  A small bronze vase containing a single flower spray was the sole ornament in the room.  This gave the keynote to Gaho's character—classic simplicity, ever reflected in his work.  He had many followers.  His method of instruction with advanced pupils was to give them subjects such as <span class="tei tei-q">“A Day in Spring,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Solitude,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“An Autumn Morning,”</span> or the like, and he was most insistent upon all the essentials to the proper effect being introduced.  His criticisms were always luminous and sympathetic.  He advised his students to copy everything good, but to imitate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span>
no-one,—to develop individuality.   He left three very distinguished and able pupils—Gyokudo, Kan Zan and Boku Sen.

Since Gaho's death, Kawabata Gyokusho, an Okyo artist, is the recognized leader of the capital.  In Kyoto, Takeuchi Seiho, an early pupil of Bairei, now occupies the foremost place, although Shonen and Keinen, pupils of Hyakunen, still hold a high rank.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Recurring to the time of Tosa, there is another school beginning under Matahei and perpetuated through many generations of popular artists, including Utamaro, Yeisen and Hokusai, and coming down to the present date.  This is the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> or floating-world-picture school.  It is far better known through its prints than its paintings.  The great painters of Japan have never held this school in any favor.  At one time or another I have visited nearly every distinguished artist's studio in Japan, and I know personally most of the leading artists of that country.  I have never seen a Japanese print in the possession of any of them, and I know their sentiments about all such work.  A print is a lifeless production, and it would be quite impossible for a Japanese artist to take prints into any serious consideration.  They rank no higher than cut velvet scenery or embroidered screens.  I am aware that such prints are in great favor with many enthusiasts and that collectors highly value them; but they do not exemplify art as the Japanese understand that term.  It must be admitted, however, that the prints have been of service in several
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span>
ways.  They first attracted the world's attention to the subject of Japanese art in general.  Commencing with an exhibition of them in London a half century ago, the prints of Ukiyo or genre subjects came rapidly into favor and ever since have commanded the notice and admiration of collectors in Europe and America.  Many people are even under the impression that the prints represent Japanese painting, which, of course, is a great mistake.  There have been artists in Japan who, in the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> manner, have painted <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">byobu</span></em> and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">makimono</span></span>. The word <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> is applied to a painting on silk or paper, wound upon a wooden roller and unrolled and hung up to be seen. <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Kakeru</span></span> means to suspend and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">mono</span></span> means an object, hence <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span>, a suspended object. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">byobu</span></em> signifies wind protector or screen; <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">makimono</span></span>, meaning a wound thing, is a painting in scroll form. It is not suspended, but simply unrolled for inspection. Such original work by Matahei and others is extant. But most of the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span>, or pictures in the popular style, are prints struck from wood blocks and are the joint production of the artist, the wood engraver, the color smearer and the printer, all of whom have contributed to and are more or less entitled to credit for the result; and that is one reason why the artist-world of Japan objects to or ignores them; they are not the spontaneous, living, palpitating production of the artist's brush.  It is well known that artists of the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> school frequently indicated only by written instructions how their outline drawings for the prints should be colored,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span>
leaving the detail of such work to the color smearer.  Apart from the fact that the colors employed were the cheapest the market afforded, and are found often to be awkwardly applied, there is too much about the prints that is measured, mechanical and calculated to satisfy Japanese art in its highest sense.  Frequently more than one engraver was employed upon a single print.  The engravers had their specialties; some were engaged for the coiffure or head-dress <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(mage),</span></span> other for the lines of the face, others for the dress <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(kimono),</span></span> others still for pattern <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(moyo)</span></em>, et cetera.  The most skilful engravers in Yedo were called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kashira bori</span></span> and were always employed on Utamaro and Hokusai prints.  Many of the colors of these prints in their soft, neutral shades, are rapturously extolled by foreign connoisseurs as evidence of the marvelous taste of the Japanese painter.  But, really, time more than art is to be credited with toning down such tints to their present delicate hues.  In this respect, like Persian rugs, they improve with age and exposure.  An additional objection to most of the prints is that they reproduce trivial, ordinary, every-day occurrences in the life of the mass of the people as it moves on.  They are more or less plebian.  The prints being intended for sale to the common people, the subjects of them, however skilfully handled, had to be commonplace.  They were not purchased by the nobility or higher classes.  Soldiers, farmers, and others bought them as presents <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(miage)</span></span> for their wives and children, and they were generally sold for a penny apiece, so that in Japan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span>
prints were a cheap substitute for art with the
lower classes, just as Raspail says garlic has always
been the camphor of the poor in France.  The practice of issuing <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> prints at very low prices still
continues in Tokyo, where every week or two such
colored publications are sprung up in front of the
book-stalls and are still as eagerly purchased by the
common people as they were in Tokugawa days.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prices the old prints now bring are out of all proportion to their intrinsic value, yet, such is the crescendo craze to acquire them that Japan has been almost drained of the supply, the number of prints of the best kind being limited, like that of Cremona violins of the good makers.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prints are genuine originals of a first or subsequent issue, called respectively, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sho han</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sai han,</span></em> or they are reproductions more or less cleverly copied upon new blocks, or they are fraudulent imitations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ganbutsu)</span></em> of the original issues, often difficult to detect.  The very wormholes are burnt into them with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">senko</span></em> or perfume sticks and clever workmen are employed to make such and other trickery successful.  A long chapter could be written about their dishonest devices.  Copies of genuine prints <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(hon koku),</span></em> made from new blocks after the manner of the ancient ones, abound, and were not intended to pass for originals.  Yedo, where the print industry was chiefly carried on, has had so many destructive conflagrations that most of the old <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> blocks have been destroyed.  At Nagoya the house of To Heki Do still preserves the original blocks of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">mangwa</span></em> or miscellaneous drawings of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span>
Hokusai, but they are  much  worn.   Prints are known by various names, such as <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">ezoshi</span></span> (illustrations), <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">nishiki e</span></span>, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">edo e</span></span> (Yedo pictures), <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sunmono</span></span> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">insatsu.</span></em> It may be of interest to know that the print blocks, when so worn as to be no longer serviceable for prints, are sometimes converted into fire-boxes <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(hibachi)</span></span> and tobacco trays <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tobacco bon)</span></span> which, when highly polished, are decorative and unique.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps a useful purpose prints have served is to record the manners and customs of the people of the periods when they were struck off.  They show not only prevailing styles of dress and headdress, but also the pursuits and amusements of the common folk.  They are excellent depositaries of dress pattern <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(moyo)</span></em> or decoration, upon which fertile subject Japan has always been a leading authority.  In the early Meiji period print painters frequently delegated such minute pattern work to their best pupils, whose seals <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(in)</span></em> will be found upon the prints thus elaborated.  The prints preserve the ruling fashions of different periods in combs and other hair ornaments, fans, foot-gear, single and multiple screens, fire-boxes and other household ornaments and utensils.  They also furnish specimens of temple and house architecture, garden plans, flower arrangements <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(ike bana),</span></span> bamboo, twig and other fences.  Again, they reproduce the stage, with its famous actors in historical dramas; battle scenes, with warriors and heroes; characters in folk-lore and other stories, and wrestling matches, with the popular champions; and we will often find upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span>
the face of the print good reproductions of Chinese and Japanese writing, in poems and descriptive prose pieces.  Hokusai illustrated much of the classic poetry of China and Japan, as well as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">senjimon,</span></em> or Thousand Character Chinese classic, a work formerly universally taught in the Japanese schools.  The original characters for this remarkable compilation were taken from the writings of Ogishi.  The prints have aided in teaching elementary history to the young; the knowledge of Japanese children in this connection is often remarkable and may be attributed to the educational influence of the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> publications.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So there are certainly good words to be said for the prints, but they are not Japanese art in its best sense, however interesting as a subordinate phase of it, and in no sense are they Japanese painting.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If limited to a choice of one artist of the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> school, no mistake would be made, I think, in selecting Hiroshige, whose landscapes fairly reproduce the sentiment of Japanese scenery, although the prints bearing his name fall far short of reproducing that artist's color schemes.  Hokusai's reputation with foreigners is greater than Hiroshige's, but Japanese artists do not take Hokusai seriously.  His pictures, they declare, reflect the restlessness of his disposition; his peaks of Fuji are all too pointed, and his manner generally is exaggerated and theatrical.  Utamaro's women of the Yoshiwara are certainly careful studies in graceful line drawing,—as correct as Greek drapery in marble.

Iwasa Matahei, the founder of the popular school, was a pupil of Mitsunori, a Kyoto artist and follower of Tosa.  Matahei disliked Tosa subjects and preferred to depict the fleeting usages of the people, so he was nicknamed Fleeting World or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo</span></span> Matahei, and thus originated the name <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> or pictures of every-day life.  There are no genuine Matahei prints.  He dates back to the seventeenth century.  Profile faces in original screen paintings by him have an Assyrian cast of countenance, the eye being painted as though seen in full face.

Hishikawa Moronobu was his follower and admirer.  He was an artist of Yedo.  Nishikawa Sukenobu belonged to the Kano school and was a pupil of Kano Eiko.  He adopted the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> style and depicted the pastimes of women and the portraits of actors.  He lived two hundred and twenty years ago and in his time prints came greatly into vogue.  Torii Kyonobu painted women and actors and invented the kind of pictured theatrical powers which are still in fashion, placarded at the entrance to theaters and showing striking incidents in the play.

Suzuki Harunobu never painted actors, preferring to reproduce the feminine beauties of his time.  It was to his careful work that was first applied the term <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">nishiki e</span></span> or brocade pictures, on account of the charm of his decorative manner.

Among the many able foreign writers on Japanese prints Fenollosa stands prominent. He resided for a long time in Japan, understood and spoke the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span>
language, and lived the life of the people.  He was
in great sympathy with them and with their art and enjoyed exceptional opportunities for seeing and studying the best treasures of that country.  Had he possessed the training necessary to paint in the Japanese style I do not think he would have devoted so much time to Japanese woodcuts.  Visiting me at Kyoto, where I was busily engaged in painting, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is what I have always longed to do.  Sooner or later I shall follow your example.”</span>  But he never did.  Instead, he issued a large work on Japanese prints.  His death was a real loss to the art literature of Japan.  During eight years he was in the service of the Japanese government ransacking, cataloguing and photographing the multitudinous art treasures, paintings, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span>, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">makimono,</span></span> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">byobu</span></em> (pictures, scrolls and screens), to be found in the various Buddhist and other temples and monasteries scattered throughout the empire.  The last time we met, he remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“How can one willingly leave this land of light?  Japan, to my mind, stands for whatever is beautiful in nature and true in art; here I hope to pass the remaining years of my life.”</span>  Such was his genuine enthusiasm, engendered by a long acquaintance with art and everything else beautiful in that country.  Japan impresses in this way all who see it under proper conditions, but unfortunately the ordinary traveler, pushed for time, and whose acquaintance is limited to professional guides, never gets much beyond the sights, the shops and the curio dealers.

There is much that has been sympathetically written and published about Japanese paintings both in Europe and America, but however laudatory, it might be all summed up under the title, <span class="tei tei-q">“Impressions of an Outsider.”</span>  Such writings lack
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span>
the authority which only constant labor in the field of practical art can confer.  A Japanese artist, by which I mean a painter, is long in making.  From ten to fifteen years of continuous study and application are required before much skill is attained.  During that time he gradually absorbs a knowledge of the many principles, precepts, maxims and methods, which together constitute the corpus or body of art doctrine handed down from a remote antiquity and preserved either in books or perpetuated by tradition.  Along with these are innumerable art secrets called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hiji</span></span> or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">himitsu,</span></span> never published, but orally imparted by the masters to their pupils—not secrets in a trick sense, but methods of execution discovered after laborious effort and treasured as valued possessions.  It is obvious, then, how incapable of writing technically upon the subject must anyone be who has not gone through such curriculum and had drilled into him all that varied instruction which makes up the body of rules applicable to that art.

I have read many seriously written appreciations of Japanese paintings published in various modern languages, and even some amiable imaginings penned for foreigners by Japanese who fancy they know by instinct what only can be acquired after long study and practice with brush in hand.  All such writers are characterized in Japan by a very polite term, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">shiroto</span></span>—which means amateur.  It also has a secondary signification of emptiness.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon a subject as technical as that of Japanese painting, to endeavor to impart correct information in a way that shall be both instructive and entertaining is an undertaking of no little difficulty.  The rules and canons of any art when enumerated, classified and explained, are likely to prove trying, if not wearisome reading.  Yet, if our object be to acquire accurate knowledge, we must consent to make some sacrifice to attain it, and there is no royal road to a knowledge of Japanese painting.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have little or no opportunity in America, excepting in one or two cities, to see good specimens of the work of the great painters of Japan. Furthermore, such work in <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> form is seen to much disadvantage when exhibited in numbers strung along the walls of a museum.  Japanese <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> (hanging paintings) are best viewed singly, suspended in the recess of the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></span> or alcove.  A certain seclusion is essential to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span>
enjoyment of their delicate and subtle effects; the surroundings should be suggestive of leisure and repose, which the Japanese word <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">shidzuka,</span></span> often employed in art language, well describes.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Japanese technique, by which I understand the established manner in which their effects in painting are produced, differs widely from that of European art.  The Japanese brushes <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(Jude</span></span> and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hake),</span></span> colors and materials influence largely the method of painting.  The canons or standards by which Japanese art is to be judged are quite special to Japan and are scarcely understood outside of it.  Since the subject is technical, to treat it in a popular way is to risk the omission of much that is essential.  I will endeavor, at any rate, to give an outline of its fundamental principles, first saying a word or two about the tools and materials.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Japanese painting no oils are used. <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Sumi</span></span> (a black color in cake form) and water-colors only are employed, while Chinese and Japanese paper and specially prepared silk take the place of canvas or other material.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Japanese artists do not paint on easels; while at work they sit on their heels and knees, with the paper or silk spread before them on a soft material, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">mosen,</span></span> which lies upon the matting or floor covering.  After one becomes accustomed to this position, he finds it gives, among other things, a very free use of the right arm and wrist.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Silk <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(e ginu)</span></span> is prepared for painting by first attaching it with boiled rice mucilage to a stretching frame.  A sizing of alum and light glue (called
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span>
<span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">dosa)</span></span> is next applied, care being taken not to wet the edges of the silk attached to the frame, which would loosen the silk.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been found that paper lasts much longer than silk, and also can be more easily restored when cracked with age.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The  artists  of the  Tosa  school  used a paper various kinds called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">tori no ko,</span></span> into the composition of which egg-shells entered.  This paper was a special product of Ichi Zen.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Kano artists used both <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">tori no ko</span></span> and a paper made from the mulberry plant, also a product of Ichi Zen, and known as <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hosho.</span></span>  For ordinary tracing a paper called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tengu jo</span></em> is used. In Okyo's time, Chinese paper made from rice-plant leaves came into vogue.  It is manufactured in large sheets and is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">toshi.</span></em> It is a light straw color, and is very responsive to the brush stroke, except when it <span class="tei tei-q">“catches cold,”</span> as the Japanese say.  It should be kept in a dry place.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Tosa artists used paper almost to the exclusion of silk.  The Kano school largely employed silk for their paintings.  Okyo also usually painted on silk.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Japanese artists seldom outline their work.  In painting on silk, a rough sketch in <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> is sometimes placed under the silk for guidance.  Outlining on paper is done with straight willow twigs of charcoal, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">yaki sumi,</span></span> easily erased by brushing with a feather.

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The law of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yo hitsu</span></em> requires a free and skilful handling of the brush, always with strict attention to the stroke, whether dot, line or mass is to be made; the brush must not touch the silk or paper before reflection has determined what the stroke or dot is to express.  Neither negligence nor indifference is tolerated.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An artist, be he ever so skilful, is cautioned not to feel entirely satisfied with his use of the brush, as it is never perfect and is always susceptible of improvement.  The brush is the handmaid of the artist's soul and must be responsive to his inspiration.  The student is warned to be as much on his guard against carelessness when handling the brush as if he were a swordsman standing ready to attack his enemy or to defend his own life; and this is the reason: Everything in art conspires to prevent success.  The softness of the brush requires the stroke to be light and rapid and the touch delicate.  The brush, when dipped first into the water, may absorb too much or not enough, and the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> or ink taken on the brush may blot or refuse to spread or flow upon the material, or it may spread in the wrong direction.  The Chinese paper <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(toshi)</span></em> which is employed in ordinary art work may be so affected by the atmosphere as to refuse to respond, and the brush stroke must be regulated accordingly.  All such matters have to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span>
be considered when the brush is being used, and if the spirit of the artist be not alert, the result is failure. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(it ten ichi boku</span></em>  <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">ni</span></span>  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">chiu</span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">o su beki.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vehicle of the subtle sentiment to be expressed in form, the brush must be so fashioned as to receive and transmit the vibrations of the artist's inner self.  Much care, much thought and skill have been expended in the manufacture of the brush.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In China, the art of writing preceded painting, and the first brushes made were writing brushes, and the more writing developed into a wonderful art, the more attention was bestowed upon the materials composing the writing brush.  Such brushes were originally made with rabbit hair, round which was wrapped the hair of deer and sheep, and the handles were mulberry stems.  Later on, as Chinese characters became more complex and writing more scientific, the brushes were most carefully made of fox and rabbit hair, with handles of ivory, and they were kept in gold and jeweled boxes.  Officials were enjoined to write all public documents with brushes having red lacquer handles, red being a positive or male <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(yo)</span></em> color.  Ogishi, the greatest of the Chinese writers, used for his brushes the feelers from around the rat's nose and hairs taken from the beak of the kingfisher.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Japan, hair of the deer, badger, rabbit, sheep, squirrel, and wild horse all enter into the manufacture of the artist's brush, which is made to
order, long or short, soft or strong, stiff or pliable.  For laying on color, the hair of the badger is preferred.  The sizes and shapes of brushes
used differ
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span>
according to the subject to be painted. There are brushes for flowers and birds, human beings, landscapes, lines of the garments, lines of the
face, for laying on color, for shading, et cetera.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A distinguishing feature in Japanese painting is the strength of the brush stroke, technically called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">fude no chikara</span></span> or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">fude no ikioi.</span></span> When representing an object suggesting strength, such, for instance, as a rocky cliff, the beak or talons of a bird, the tiger's claws, or the limbs and branches of a tree, the moment the brush is applied the sentiment of strength must be invoked and felt throughout the artist's system and imparted through his arm and hand to the brush, and so transmitted into the object painted; and this nervous current must be continuous and of equal intensity  while the work proceeds.  If the tree's limbs or branches in a painting by a Kano artist be examined, it will astonish any one to perceive the vital force that has been infused into them.  Even the smallest twigs appear filled with the power of growth—all the result of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">fude no chikara.</span></span>  Indeed, when this principle is understood, and in the light of it the trees of many of the Italian and French artists are critically viewed, they appear flabby, lifeless, and as though they had been done with a feather.  They lack that vigor which is attained only by <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">fude no chikara,</span></span> or brush strength.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In writing Chinese characters in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">rei sho</span></em> manner this same principle is carefully inculcated.  The characters must be executed with the feeling of their being carved on stone or engraved on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span>
steel—such must be the force transmitted through the arm and hand to the brush.   Thus executed the writings seem imbued with living strength.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is related of Chinanpin, the great Chinese painter, that an art student having applied to him for instruction, he painted an orchid plant and told the student to copy it.  The student did so to his own satisfaction, but the master told him he was far away from what was most essential.  Again and again, during several months, the orchid was reproduced, each time an improvement on the previous effort, but never meeting with the master's approval.  Finally Chinanpin explained as follows: The long, blade-like leaves of the orchid may droop toward the earth but they all long to point to the sky, and this tendency is called cloud-longing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(bo un)</span></em> in art. When, therefore, the tip of the long slender leaf is reached by the brush the artist must feel that the same is longing to point to the clouds.  Thus painted, the true spirit and living force <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(kokoromochi)</span></span> of the plant are preserved.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Kubota recommended to art students and artists to a practice with lines which is excellent for acquiring and retaining firmness and freedom of the arm, with steady and continuous strength in the stroke.  With a brush held strictly perpendicular to the paper horizontal lines are painted, first from right to left, the entire width of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">toshi</span></em> or other paper, each line with equal thickness and unwavering intensity of power throughout its entire length.  The thickness of the line will depend upon the amount of hair in the brush that is allowed to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span>
touch the paper; if only the tip of the brush be
used, the line will be slender or thin; but, whether
a broad band or a delicate tracing, it must be uniform throughout and filled with living force.  Next,
the lines are painted from left to right in the same
way and with the same close attention to uniform
thickness and continuous flow of nervous strength
from start to finish.   Then, the increasingly difficult task is to paint them from top to bottom of
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">toshi,</span></em> and finally, most difficult and most
important of all these exercises, the parallel lines
are traced from bottom to top of the paper.  The
thinner the line the more difficult it is to execute,
because of the tendency of the hand to tremble.  
Indeed, the difficulty is supreme.   Let any one who
is interested try this; it is an exercise for the most
expert.  Such lines resemble the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">sons filés</span></span> on the
violin, where a continuous sustained tone of equal
intensity is produced by drawing the bow from
heel to tip so slowly over the strings that it hardly
moves.  Practicing lines in the way indicated gives
steadiness and strength, qualities in demand at
every instant in Japanese art.  Observe a Japanese
artist paint the young branch of a plum tree shooting from the trunk.  The new year's growth starting, it may be, from the bottom of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">toshi</span></em> will be
projected to the top.  Examine it carefully and it
will be found to conform to that principle of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">jude
no chikara</span></span> which transfers a living force into the
branch.  I have seen European artists in Japan
vainly try offhand to produce such effects;  but
these depend on long and patient practice.

A Japanese artist will frequently ignore the boundaries of the paper upon which he paints by beginning his stroke upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">mosen</span></em> and continuing it upon the paper—or beginning it upon the paper and projecting it upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">mosen.</span></em>  This produces the sentiment or impression of great strength of stroke.  It animates the work.  And in this energetic kind of painting, if drops of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> accidentally fall from the brush upon the painting they are regarded as giving additional energy to it.  Similarly, if the stroke on the trunk or branch of a tree shows many thin hair lines where the intention was that the line should be solid, this also is regarded as an additional evidence of stroke energy and is always highly prized.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same principle applies in the art of Chinese writing; but this effect must not be the result of calculation—it must be what in art is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shi zen,</span></em>  meaning spontaneous.

In painting the hair of monkeys, bears and the like, the pointed brush is flattened and spread out <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(wari fude)</span></span> so that each stroke of the same will reproduce numberless thin lines, corresponding to the hairs of the animal.  Sosen thus painted.  In modern times Kimpo <a href="#plate05" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate V)</span></a> is justly renowned for such work.

Many artists become wonderfully expert in the use of the flat brush, from one to four inches wide, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hake,</span></span> by means of which instantaneous effects such as rain, rocks, mountain chains and snow scenes are secured.

The brush should be often and thoroughly rinsed during the time that it is used and washed and dried when not employed.  In Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo there are famous manufacturers of artists' brushes, and names of makers such as Nishimura, Sugiyama, Hakkado, Onkyodo and Kiukyodo are familiar to all the artists of the country.

Not only is this black color <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(sumi)</span></span> used in all water color work, but it is frequently the only color employed; and a painting thus executed, according to the laws of Japanese art, is called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi e</span></span> and is regarded as the highest test of the artist's skill.

Ink is the very opposite of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> both in its composition and effect.  Ink is an acid and fluid.  <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Sumi</span></span> is a solid made from the soot obtained by burning certain plants (for the best results <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">juncus communis,</span></span> bull rush, or the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sessamen orientalis),</span></span> combined with glue from deer horn.

The methods of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> manufacture are carefully guarded secrets.  China during the Ming dynasty, three centuries ago, produced the best <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi,</span></span> although China <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(toboku)</span></em> employed twelve centuries past shows both in writing and in painting as distinctly and brilliantly today as though it were but recently manufactured.  Nara, near Kyoto, was the birthplace of Japanese <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi,</span></span> and the house of Kumagai <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(Kyukyodo)</span></span> for centuries has had its manufacturers in that city.  In Tokyo a distinguished maker, whose <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> many of the artists there prefer, is Baisen.  He has devoted fifty years of his life to the study and compounding of this precious article.  He possesses some great secrets of manufacture which may die with him.  In Okyo's time there was a dark blue <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ai en boku</span></em> but the art and secret of its manufacture are lost.

In using <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> the cake is moistened and rubbed on a slab called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">suzuri,</span></span> producing a semi-fluid.

It is very important while painting with <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> to renew its strength frequently by fresh applications of the cake to the slab.  The color and richness of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> left upon the slab soon fade; and though when used this may not be apparent, when the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> dries on the paper or silk its weakness is speedily perceived.

Artists are readily recognized in their work by their manner of using or laying on <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi.</span></span>  The color, the sheen, the shadings and the flow of the ink enable us even to determine the disposition or state of mind of the artist at the time of painting, so sensitive, so responsive is <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> to the mood of the artist using it.  There is much of engaging interest in connection with this subject.  Artists become most difficult to satisfy on the subject of the various kinds of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi,</span></span> which differ as much in their special qualities as the tones

of celebrated violins. It is interesting to observe how different the color or richness of the same <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> becomes according to the varying skill with which it is applied.

The most valuable stone for <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">suzuri</span></span> is known throughout the entire oriental world as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tan kei</span></em> and is found in the mountain of Fuka in China.  This stone has gold streaks through it, with small dots called bird's eyes.  The water which flows from Fuka mountain is blue.  The color of the rock is violet.  A favorite color for the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">suzuri</span></span> (in Chinese called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ken)</span></em> is lion's liver.  Formerly much ceremony was observed in mining for this stone and sheep and cattle were offered in sacrifice, else it was believed that the stone would be struck by a thunderbolt and reduced to ashes in the hands of its possessor.  The <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">suzuri</span></span> is also made in China from river sediment fashioned and baked.  Still another method is to make the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">suzuri</span></span> from paper and the varnish of the lacquer tree.

The skilful use of water colors is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sesshoku.</span></em> 
It is more difficult to paint with <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> alone than
use of water to paint with the aid of colors, which can hide
defects never to be concealed in a <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi e,</span></span> where

Japanese painters as a rule are sparing of colors, the slightest amount used discreetly and with restraint generally sufficing.  Many artists have not the color sense or dislike color and seldom use it.  Kubota often declared he hoped to live until he might feel justified in discarding color and employing <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> alone for any and all effects in painting.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are eight different ways of painting in
color.  I will enumerate them, with their technical,
descriptive terms:
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the best form of color painting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(goku zai shiki)</span></em> <a href="#plate09" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate IX)</span></a> the color is most carefully laid on, being applied three times or oftener if necessary.  On account of these repeated coats this form is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tai chaku shoku.</span></em>  This style of painting is reserved for temples, gold screens, palace ceilings and the like.  Tosa and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Yamato e</span></span> painters generally followed this manner.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next best method of coloring <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(chu zai shiki)</span></em> <a href="#plate10" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate X)</span></a> is termed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">chaku shoku,</span></em> or the ordinary application of color.  The Kano and Shijo schools use this method extensively, as did also the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> painters.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The light water-color method, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tan sai</span></em> <a href="#plate11" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate XI)</span></a>, is employed in the ordinary style of painting <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> and is much used by the Okyo school.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A well-known method by which the autumnal tints of forest leaves are produced is to take up with the brush one after another and in the following order these colors: Yellow-green <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(ki iro),</span></span> brown <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(tai sha),</span></em> red <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(shu),</span></em> crimson <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(beni),</span></span> and last, and on the very tip of the brush, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi.</span></span>  The brush thus charged and dexterously applied gives a charming autumn effect, the colors shading into each other as in nature.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are five parent colors in Japanese art: parent colors Blue <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sei),</span></em> yellow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(au),</span></em> black (koku), white <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(byaku),</span></em> combinations and red <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(seki).</span></em>  These in combination <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(cho go)</span></em> originate other colors as follows:  Blue and  yellow produce green <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(midori);</span></span> blue and black, dark blue <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(ai nezumi);</span></span> blue and white, sky-blue <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(sora iro);</span></span>

Powdered gold and silver, and crimson made from the saffron plant are also employed.  The colors, excepting yellow, are prepared for use by mixing them with light glue upon a saucer.  With yellow, water alone is used.  In addition to all the foregoing there are other expensive colors used in careful work and known as mineral earths <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(iwamono).</span></span>  They are blue <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(gunjo),</span></em> dark or Prussian blue <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(konjo),</span></em> light bluish-green <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(gunroku),</span></em> green <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(rokusho),</span></em> light green <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(byakugun),</span></em> pea green <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(cha-roku sho)</span></em> and light red <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sango matsu).</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The use of primary colors in a painting in proximity to secondary ones originated by them is color to be avoided, as both lose by such contrast; and when a color-scheme fails to give satisfaction it will usually be found that this cardinal principle of harmony, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">iro no kubari,</span></span> has been disregarded by the artist.  Color in art is the dress, the apparel in which the work is clad.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When a Japanese artist is preparing to paint a picture he considers first the space the picture is to occupy and its shape, whether square, oblong, round or otherwise; next, the distribution of light and shade, and then the placing of the objects in the composition so as to secure harmony and effective contrasts.  In settling these questions he relies largely on the laws of proportion and design.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principles of proportion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ichi)</span></em> and design <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(isho)</span></em> are closely allied.  They aim to supply and express with sobriety what is essential to the composition, proportion determining the just arrangement and distribution of the component parts, and design the manner in which the same shall be handled.  In a landscape, proportion may require the balancing effect of buildings and trees, while design will determine how the same may be picturesquely presented; for instance, by making the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span>
trees partially hide the buildings, thus provoking
a desire to see more than is shown.  Such suggestion
or stimulation of the imagination is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yukashi</span></em>.
The Japanese painter is early taught the value of
suppression in design—<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">l'art d'ennuyer est de tout dire</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A well-known rule of proportion, quaintly expressed in the original Chinese and which is more or less adhered to in practice, requires in a landscape painting that if the mountain be, for example, ten feet high the trees should be one foot, a horse one inch and a man the size of a bean.  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jo san seki ju, sun ba to jin</span></em> <a href="#plate17" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate XVII)</span></a>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Design, called in art <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">isho zuan</span></em> or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">takumi,</span></span> is largely the personal equation of the artist.  It is his power of presenting and expressing what he treats in an original manner.  The subject may not be new, but its treatment must be fresh and attractive.  Much will depend upon the learning and the technical ability of the artist.  In the matter of design the artists of Tokyo have always differed from those of Kyoto, the former aiming at lively and even startling effects, while the latter seek to produce a quieter or more subdued <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(otonashi)</span></span> result.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where landscapes or trees are to be painted upon a single panel, panels on each side of it may be conveniently placed and the painting designed upon the central panel in connection with the two additional ones used for elaboration.  In this way, when the side panels are withdrawn the effect is as though such landscape or trees were seen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span>
through an open window, and all cramped or forced appearance is avoided.  The <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Ukiyo e</span></span> artists practiced a similar method in their <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hashirakake</span></span> or long, narrow, panel-like prints of men and women used for decorating upright beams in a room.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The literature of art abounds in instances illustrative of correct proportion and design.

The artist Buncho being requested to paint a crow flying across a <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma</span></span> or four sliding door-like panels, after much reflection painted the bird in the act of disappearing from the last of these subdivisions, the space of the other three suggesting the rapid flight which the crow had already accomplished, and the law of proportion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ichi)</span></em> or orderly arrangement thus observed was universally applauded.

In the wooded graveyard of the temple at Ike-gami, where the tombs of so many of the Kano artists (including Tanyu) are to be found, is a stone marking the grave of a Kano painter who, having executed an order for a picture and his patron observing that it was lacking in design and that he must add a certain gold effect in the color scheme, rather than violate his own convictions of what he considered proper design, first refused to comply and then committed <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hara kiri.</span></span>

A canon of Japanese art which is at the base of
one of the peculiar charms of Japanese pictures,
not merely in the whole composition but also in
minute details that might escape the attention at
first glance, requires that there should be in every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span>
painting the sentiment of active and passive, light and shade.  This is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in yo</span></em> and is based upon the principle of contrast for heightening effects.  The term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in yo</span></em> originated in the earliest doctrines of Chinese philosophy and has always existed in the art language of the Orient.  It signifies darkness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(in)</span></em> and light <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(yo),</span></em> negative and positive, female and male, passive and active, lower and upper, even and odd.  This term is of constant application in painting.  A picture with its lights and shades properly distributed conforms to the law of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in yo.</span></em>  Two flying crows, one with its beak closed, the other with its beak open; two tigers in their lair, one with the mouth shut, the other with the teeth showing; or two dragons, one ascending to the sky and the other descending to the ocean, illustrate phases of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in yo.</span></em> Mountains, waves, the petals of a flower, the eyeball of a bird, rocks, trees—all have their negative and positive aspects, their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in</span></em> and their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yo.</span></em>  The observance of this canon secures not only the effective contrast of light and shade in a picture but also an equally striking contrast between the component parts of each object composing it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The law of form, in art called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">keisho</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">kakko,</span></em> is widely applied for determining not only the correct shape of things but also their suitable or proper presentation according to circumstances.  It has to do with all kinds of attitudes and dress.  It determines what is suitable for the prince and for the beggar, for the courtier and for the peasant.  It regulates the shape that objects should take
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span>
according to conditions surrounding them, whether
seen near or far off, in mist or in rain or snow, in
motion or in repose. The exact shape of objects in motion (as an animal running, a bird flying or a fish swimming) no one can see, but the painter who has observed, studied and knows by heart the form or shape of these objects in repose can, by virtue of his skill, reproduce them in motion, foreshortened or otherwise; that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">keisho;</span></em> and he is taught and well understands that if in executing such work his memory of essential details fails him hesitancy is apt to cause the picture to perish as a work of art.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Keisho</span></em> literally means shape, but in oriental art it signifies also the proprieties; it is a law which enforces among other things canons of good taste and suppresses all exaggerations, inartistic peculiarities and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grimaces.</span></em>

The law touching historical subjects and the manner of painting them is called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ko jutsu.</span></em>  Special principles apply to this department of Japanese art.  The
historical painter must know all the historical details of the period to which his painting relates,
including a knowledge of the arms, accoutrements, costumes, ornaments, customs and the like.  This
subject covers too vast a field and is too important to be summarily treated here.  Suffice it to say
that there have been many celebrated historical painters in Japan.  I recall, on the other hand, a
picture once exhibited by a distinguished Tokyo artist which was superbly executed but wholly ignored by
the jury because it violated some canon applicable to historical painting.

The term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yu shoku</span></em> refers to the laws governing the practices of the Imperial
household, Buddhist and Shinto rites.  Before attempting any work of art in which these may figure the
painter must be thoroughly versed in the appointments of palace interiors, the rules of etiquette, the
occupations and pastimes of the Emperor, court nobles <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(Kuge),</span></span>

the costumes of the females <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tsubone)</span></span> of the Imperial household and their
duties and accomplishments.  The Tosa school made a thorough familiarity with such details its specialty.  All Buddhist paintings come under the law of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yu shoku.</span></em>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us next consider briefly some of the principles applicable to Japanese landscape painting.  Landscapes are known in art by the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">san sui,</span></em> which means mountain and water.  This Chinese term would indicate that the artists of China considered both mountains and water to be essential to landscape subjects, and the tendency in a Japanese artist to introduce both into his painting is ever noticeable.  If he cannot find the water elsewhere he takes it from the heavens in the shape of rain.  Indeed, rain and wind subjects are much in favor and wonderful effects are produced in their pictures suggesting the coming slorm, where the wind makes the bamboos and trees take on new, weird and fantastic shapes.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The landscape <a href="#plate18" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate XVIII)</span></a> contains a lofty mountain, rocks, river, road, trees, bridge, man, animal, et cetera.  The first requisite in such, a composition is that the picture respond to the law
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span>
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten chi jin,</span></em> or heaven, earth and man.  This wonderful law of Buddhism is said to pervade the universe and is of widest application to all the art of man.  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ten chi jin</span></em> means that whatever is worthy of contemplation must contain a principal subject, its complimentary adjunct, and auxiliary details.  Thus is the work rounded out to its perfection.
</p>

Plate VI.</div></div>


<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This law of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten chi jin</span></em> applies not only to painting but to poetry (its elder sister), to architecture, to garden plans, as well as to flower arrangement; in fact, it is a universal, fundamental law of correct construction.  In <a href="#plate18" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate XVIII</span></a> the mountain is the dominant or principal feature.  It commands our first attention.  Everything is subservient to it.  It, therefore, is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten,</span></em> or heaven.  Next in importance, complimentary to the mountain, are the rocks.  These, therefore, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">chi,</span></em> or earth; while all that contributes to the movement or life of the picture, to wit, the trees, man, animal, bridge and river, are styled <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">jin,</span></em> or man, so that the picture satisfies the first law of composition, namely, the unity in variety required by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten chi jin.</span></em>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another law which determines the general character to be given a landscape according to the season, and is thus expressed:  Mountains in spring should suggest joyousness; in summer, green and moisture; in autumn, abundance; in winter, drowsiness.   The formula runs as follows: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shun-zan,</span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">warau gotoshi;</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">kazan,</span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">arau gotoshi;</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shuzan,</span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">yoso gotoshi;</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tozan,</span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">nemurugotoku.</span></span>
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Similarly, according to the season, there are four principal ways of painting bamboo <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(chiku).</span></em>  In fair-weather bamboo <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sei chiku)</span></em> the leaves are spread out joyously; in rainy-weather bamboo <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(uchiku)</span></em> the leaves hang down despondently; in windy-weather bamboo <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(fuchiku)</span></em> the leaves cross each other confusedly, and in the dew of early morning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(rochiku)</span></em> the bamboo leaves all point upwards vigorously <a href="#plate53" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate LIII a 1 to a 4)</span></a>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Kano artists differ from the Shijo painters in their manner of combining <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(kasaneru)</span></span> the leaves and branches of the bamboo.  Speaking generally, the Shijo artists point the leaves downward, while the former point them upward, which is more effective.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, in snow scenery the Kano artists first paint the bottom of the snow-line and then by shading <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(kumadori)</span></span> above the same with very light ink <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(usui sumi)</span></span> produce the effect of accumulated snow.  The Okyo school secures the same result in a much more brilliant manner, using but a single dexterous stroke of the well-watered brush, the point only of which is tipped with <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some artisls, notably Kubota Beisen and his followers, employ both methods, the former for near and the latter for distant snow landscapes.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Low mountains in a landscape suggest great distance.  Fujiyama, the favorite subject of all artists, should not be painted too high, else it loses in dignity by appearing too near.  In an art work written by Oishi Shuga, Fuji is reproduced as it appears at every season of the year, whether clad in snow, partly concealed by clouds, or plainly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span>
visible in unobstructed outline.  The book is a safe guide for artists to consult.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may next consider some laws applicable to mountains, rocks and ledges.  It has long since been observed by the great writers on art in China that mountains, rocks, ledges and peaks have certain characteristics which distinguish them.  These differ not only with their geological formations but also vary with the seasons on account of the different grasses and growths which may more or less alter or conceal them.  To attempt to reproduce them as seen were a hopeless task, there being too much confusing detail; hence, salient features only are noted, studied and painted according to what is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shun po,</span></em> or the law of ledges or stratifications.  There are eight different ways in which rocks, ledges and the like may be represented:

These eight laws are not only available guides to desired effects; they also abbreviate labor and save the artist's attempting the impossible task of exactly reproducing physical conditions of the earth in a landscape painting.  They are symbols or substitutes for the truth felt.  Nothing is more interesting than such art resources whereby the sentiment of a landscape is reproduced by thus suggesting or symbolizing many of its essential features.

It was a theory of the great Chinese teacher, Chinanpin, and particularly enforced by him, that trees, plants and grasses take the form of a circle, called in art <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">rin kan</span></em> (see <a href="#plate27" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate XXVII</span></a>), No. 1; or a semi-circle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(han kan)</span></em> <a href="#plate07" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate XXVII)</span></a>, No. 2; or an aggregation of half-circles, called fish scales <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(gyo rin)</span></em> <a href="#plate27" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate XXVII)</span></a>, No. 3; or a modification of these latter, called moving fish scales <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(gyo rin katsu ho)</span></em> <a href="#plate27" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate XXVII)</span></a>, No 4.

In <a href="#plate29" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate XXIX</span></a>, according to this method, is constructed the entire skeleton of a forest tree.  In Nos. 1 and 2 on this plate numerous small circles are indicated.  These show where each stroke of the brush begins, the points of commencement being of prime importance to correct effect.  In No. 3, same plate, we have the foundation work of a tree in a Japanese painting. It is needless to point out the marvelous vigor

apparent in work constructed according to the above principles.

In the painting of rocks, ledges, and the like, Chinanpin taught that the curved lines of the fish scales are to be changed into straight lines, three in number, of different lengths, two being near together and the third line slightly separated, and all either perpendicular or horizontal, as in <a href="#plate20" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate XXX</span></a>, Nos. 1 and 2.

There are many quaint aids to artistic effects from time immemorial well known to and favored by the old Chinese painters and still successfully practiced in Japan.

In addition to these, the general shapes of certain of the Chinese written characters are invoked for reproducing winding streams <a href="#plate20" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate XX)</span></a>, groupings of rocks, meadow, swamp, and other grasses and the like.

In this connection I would allude to criticisms or judgments upon Japanese painting in which particular stress is laid upon its calligraphic quality.  If any Japanese artist was seriously informed that his method of painting was calligraphic, he would explode with mirth.  There are several ways to account for this rather wide-spread error.  Much that is written about Japanese painting and its calligraphy is but the repetition by one author of what he has taken on trust from another, an effective way sometimes of spreading misinformation.  It is quite true that the assiduous study of Chinese writing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sho)</span></em> is an essential part of thorough art education in Japan, not, however, for the purpose of learning to paint as one writes, or of introducing written characters more or less transformed into a painting (if that be what is meant by <span class="tei tei-q">“calligraphic”</span>), but simply to give the artist freedom, confidence, and grace in the handling of the brush and to train his eye to form and balance and to acquire both strength of stroke and a knowledge of the sequence of strokes.  To write in Chinese after the manner of professionals <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sho ka)</span></em> is truly a great art, esteemed even higher than painting; it requires thirty years of constant practice to become expert therein, and it has many laws and profound principles which, if mastered by artists, will enable them to be all the greater in their painting, and many Japanese artists have justly prided 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span>
themselves upon being expert writers of the Chinese characters.  Okyo practiced daily for three years the writing of two intricate characters standing for his name, until he was satisfied with their forms, but there is nothing calligraphic about any of Okyo's painting.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Possibly what has misled foreign critics and even some Japanese writers is that there exists a class of men in Japan given to learning, to writing, and also to painting in a particular way.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These men are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">bun jin</span></em> (literati) and their style of painting is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">bun jin fu.</span></em>  They are not artists, but are known as Confucius' scholars <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ju sha)</span></em>, and being professional or trained writers in the difficult art of Chinese calligraphy they have a manner of painting strictly <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis.</span></span>  It is known as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">nan gwa</span></em> or southern literary way of painting.  Their subjects are the bamboo, the plum, the orchid and the chrysanthemum, called the four paragons <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(shi kun shi).</span></em>  These and landscapes they paint with their writing brush and more or less in what is called the grass character <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(so sho)</span></em> manner of writing.  In fact, they often aim to make their painting look like writing and they rarely use any color except light-brown <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(tai sha).</span></em>  They suppress line as distinguished from mass.  This method is called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">bokkotsu</span></span> (see <a href="#plate12" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate XII</span></a>). Such painting of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">nan gwa</span></em> school is, in a sense, calligraphic, but that is not the kind of painting which Japanese artists are taught, practice and profess, nor is it even recognized as an art, but simply as an eccentric development of the literary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span>
man with a taste for painting.   At one time or another well-known artists, especially at the beginning of the Meiji era, have affected this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">bun jin</span></em> calligraphy style simply as a passing fashion.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One other possible explanation of the critics pronouncing all Japanese paintings calligraphic is that various Chinese characters are, as we have seen, invoked and employed by Japanese artists as memory aids to producing certain effects; but were these characters introduced calligraphically, the result would be laughable.  It should be plain then that Japanese painting is not calligraphic; as well apply the term calligraphy to one of Turner's water colors.  On the other hand, Chinese writing is built up on word pictures. There are between five and six hundred mother characters, all imitating the shapes of objects; these, with their later combinations, constitute the Chinese written system, so that while there is nothing calligraphic about Japanese painting, there is much that is pictorial about Chinese calligraphy.

Other landscape laws applicable to things seen at a distance in a painting require that distant trees should show no branches nor leaves; people at a distance, no features; distant mountains, no ledges; distant seas or rivers, no waves.  Again, clouds should indicate whence they come; running water the direction of its source; mountains, their chains; and roads, whither they lead.

In regard to painting moving waters, whether of deep or shallow, in rivers or brooks, bays or oceans, Chinanpin declared it was impossible for the eye

to seize their exact forms because they are ever changing and have no fixed, definite shape, therefore they can not be sketched satisfactorily; yet, as moving water must be represented in painting, it should be long and minutely contemplated by the artist, and its general character—whether leaping in the brook, flowing in the river, roaring in the cataract, surging in the ocean or lapping the shore—observed and reflected upon, and after the eye and memory are both sufficiently trained and the very soul of the artist is saturated, as it were, with this one subject and he feels his whole being calm and composed, he should retire to the privacy of his studio and with the early morning sun to gladden his spirit there attempt to reproduce the movement of the flow; not by copying what he has seen, for the effect would be stiff and wooden, but by symbolizing according to certain laws what he feels and remembers.

The leaves of the bamboo are green at all seasons.  The stems are straight and point upwards.

It is said that the full moon casts the shadow of the bamboo in a way no other light approaches.

Nightly he used to trace with <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> such bamboo shadows on his paper window.  Sho Hin, a lady artist of Tokyo, enjoys a well-earned reputation for painting bamboo.  She was a pupil of Tai Zan, a Kyoto representative of the Chinese school.  The Kano painters much favored the subject of the seven sages in the bamboo grove.  Bamboo grass <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sassa)</span></em> is much painted by all the schools.  It is very decorative.

The plum is the first tree of the year to bloom.  It has a dejicate perfume.  Though the trunk of the tree grows old it renews its youth and beauty every spring with vigorous fresh branches crowded with buds and blossoms.

The impression produced on one who for the first time hears enumerated these various laws may possibly be that all such methods for securing artistic effects are arbitrary, mechanical and unnatural.  But in practice, the artist who invokes their aid finds they produce invariably pleasing and satisfactory results.  It must not be supposed that such laws are exclusive of all other methods of painting in the Japanese style.  On the contrary the artist is at liberty to use any other method he may select provided the result is artistically correct.  Many painters have invented methods of their own which are not included in the foregoing enumeration of these laws of lines, dots and ledges, which, it must always be borne in mind, are only to assist the artist who may be in doubt or difficulty as to how he shall best express the effect he aims at.  It is such second nature for him to employ them that he does so as unconsciously as one in writing will invoke the rules of grammar.  It is related that a great statesman, being asked if it were necessary for a diplomat to know Latin and Greek, replied that it was quite sufficient for him to have forgotten them.  And so with these laws.  A knowledge of them is a necessary part of the education of every Japanese artist, for they lie at the very foundation of the art of oriental painting.  Chinese writing abounds with similar principles; it is a law applicable to one kind of such writing, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">rei sho,</span></em> that in each character there shall be one stroke which begins with the head of a silkworm and terminates with a goose's tail.  This also may

Some acquaintance with these principles and methods invoked by artists adds much to our keen enjoyment of their work, just as an analysis of the chords in a musical composition increases our pleasure in the harmonies they produce.  Ruskin has discovered in the very earliest art the frequent use of simple forms suggested by the slightly curved and springing profile of the leaf bud which, he declares, is of enormous importance even in mountain ranges, when not vital but falling force is suggested.  <span class="tei tei-q">“This abstract conclusion the great thirteenth century artists were the first to arrive at”</span> (Ruskin's Mod. Painters, Vol. III), and even in the architecture of the best cathedrals that author detects the observance of the law determining in an ivy leaf the arrangement of its parts about a center.

In Japanese art simple forms supplied by nature are often used for suggesting other forms as, for instance, the stork's legs for the pine tree branches, the turtle's back for the pine bark lines, the fish tail for bamboo leafage, the elephant's eye in the orchid plant, the shape of Fujiyama for the forehead of a beautiful woman, and various Chinese characters, originally pictorial, adumbrated in trees, flowers and other subjects.  The universality of such underlying type forms recognized and applied by oriental artists is confirmatory of the principle that in both nature and art all is united by a common

chain or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">commune vinculum</span></span> attesting the harmony between created things.

To give some idea of the order in which the component parts of an object are painted according to Japanese rules, which are always stringently insisted upon, flowers like the chrysanthemum and peony are begun at their central point and built up from within outwardly, the petals being added to increase the size as the flower opens.  In a flower subject the blossoms are painted first; the buds come next; then the stem, stalks, leaves and their veinings, and lastly the dots called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">chobo chobo.</span></span>

One of the most important principles in the
art of Japanese painting—indeed, a fundamental and entirely distinctive characteristic—is that called living movement, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sei do,</span></em> or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kokoro mochi,</span></span> it being, so to say, the transfusion into the work of the felt nature of the thing to be painted by the artist.  Whatever the subject to be translated—whether river or tree, rock or mountain, bird or flower, fish or animal—the artist at the moment of painting it must feel its very nature, which, by the magic of his art, he transfers into his work to remain forever, affecting all who see it with the same sensations he experienced when executing it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is not an imaginary principle but a strictly enforced law of Japanese painting.  The student is incessantly admonished to observe it.  Should his subject be a tree, he is urged when painting it to feel the strength which shoots through the branches
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span>
and sustains the limbs.  Or if a flower, to try to feel the grace with which it expands or bows its blossoms.  Indeed, nothing is more constantly urged upon his attention than this great underlying principle, that it is impossible to express in art what one does not first feel.  The Romans taught their actors that they must first weep if they would move others to tears.  The Greeks certainly understood the principle, else how did they successfully invest with imperishable life their creations in marble?

The Japanese artist is taught that even to the placing of a dot in the eyeball of a tiger he must first feel the savage, cruel, feline character of the beast, and only under such influence should he apply the brush.  If he paint a storm, he must at the moment realize passing over him the very tornado which tears up trees from their roots and houses from their foundations.  Should he depict the seacoast with its cliffs and moving waters, at the moment of putting the wave-bound rocks into the picture he must feel that they are being placed there to resist the fiercest movement of the ocean, while to the waves in turn he must give an irresistible power to carry all before them; thus, by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span>
this sentiment, called living movement <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sei do),</span></em> reality is imparted to the inanimate object.  This is one of the marvelous secrets of Japanese painting, handed down from the great Chinese painters and based on psychological principles—matter responsive to mind.  Chikudo, the celebrated tiger painter <a href="#plate06" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">(Plate VI)</span></a>, studied and pondered so long over the savage expression in the eye of the tiger in order to reproduce its fierceness that, it is related, he became at one time mentally unbalanced, but his paintings of tigers are inimitable.

It is largely because of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">esoragoto</span></span> or the admixture of invention (the artistic unreality) with the unartistic reality; the poetic handling or treatment of what in the original may in some respects be commonplace.

A correctly executed Japanese painting in <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi e,</span></span> is essentially a false picture so far as color goes, where anything in it not black is represented.  Hence, <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> paintings of landscapes, flowers and trees, are untrue as to color, and the art lies in making things thus represented seem the opposite of what they appear and cause the sentiment of color to be felt through a medium which contains no color.  This is <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">esoragoto.</span></span>

It is related that Okubo Shibutsu, famous for painting bamboo, was requested to execute a <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> representing a bamboo forest.  Consenting, he painted with all his known skill a picture in which the entire bamboo grove was in red. The patron upon its receipt marveled at the extraordinary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span>
skill with which the painting had been executed, and, repairing to the artist's residence, he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Master, I have come to thank you for the picture; but, excuse me, you have painted the bamboo red.”</span>  <span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> cried the master, <span class="tei tei-q">“in what color would you desire it?”</span>  <span class="tei tei-q">“In black, of course,”</span> replied the patron.  <span class="tei tei-q">“And who,”</span> answered the artist, <span class="tei tei-q">“ever saw a black-leaved bamboo?”</span>  This story well illustrates <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">esoragoto.</span></span>  The Japanese are so accustomed to associate true color with what the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> stands for that not only is fiction in this respect permissible but actually missed when not employed.  In a landscape painting effects are frequently introduced which are not to be found in the scene sketched.  The false or fictitious is added to heighten the effect.  This is <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">esoragoto—</span></span> the privileged departure, the false made to seem true.  In a landscape a tree is often found to occupy an unfortunate place or there is no tree where its presence would heighten the effect.  Here the artist will either suppress or add it, according to the necessities of treatment.  Not every landscape is improved by trees or plantations; nor, indeed, is every view containing trees a type scene for landscape treatment.  Hence, certain liberties are conceded the artist provided only the effect is pleasing and satisfactory and that no probabilities seem violated.  This is <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">esoragoto.</span></span>  Horace understood this and lays it down as a fundamental principle in art: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid libet audendi</span></span>”</span>.  The artist will oftentimes see from a point of view impossible in nature, but if the result is pleasing the liberty is accorded.  Sesshu, one of the greatest landscape
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span>
painters of Japan, on returning to his own country after having studied some years in China, made a painting of his native village with its temple and temple groves, winding river and pagoda or five-roofed tower.  His attention being subsequently called to the fact that in this village there was no tower or pagoda, he exclaimed that there ought to be one to make the landscape perfect, and thereupon he had the tower constructed at his own expense.  He had painted in the pagoda unconsciously.  This was <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">esoragoto.</span></span>

There are no people in the world who have a higher idea of the dignity of art than the Japanese and it is a principle with them that every painting worthy of the name should reflect that dignity, should testify to its own worth and thus justly impress with sentiments of admiration those to whom it may be shown.  This intrinsic loftiness, elevation or worth is known in their art by the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ki in.</span></em>  Without this quality the painting, artistically considered and critically judged, must be pronounced a failure.  Such picture may be perfect; in proportion and design, correct in brush force and faultless in color scheme; it may have complied with the principles of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in yo</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten, chi, jin</span></em> or heaven, earth and man; it may have scrupulously observed all the rules of lines, dots and ledges and yet if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ki in</span></em> be wanting the painting has failed as a work of true art.

In our varied experiences of life we all have met with noble men and women whose beautiful and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span>
elevating characters have impressed us the moment we have been brought into relation with them.  The same quality which thus affects us in persons is what the Japanese understand by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ki in</span></em> in a painting.  It is that indefinable something which in every great work suggests elevation of sentiment, nobility of soul.  From the earliest times the great art writers of China and Japan have declared that this quality, this manifestation of the spirit, can neither be imparted nor acquired.  It must be innate.  It is, so to say, a divine seed implanted in the soul by the Creator, there to unfold, expand and blossom, testifying its hidden residence with greater or lesser charm according to the life spent, great principles adhered to and ideals realized.  Such is what the Japanese understand by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ki in.</span></em>  It is, I think, akin to what the Romans meant by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">divinus afflatus—</span></span>that divine and vital breath, that emanation of the soul, which vivifies and ennobles the work and renders it immortal.  And it is a striking commentary upon artist life in Japan that many of the great artists of the Tosa and Kano schools, in the middle years of their active lives, retired from the world, shaved their heads, and, taking the titular rank of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">hogen, hoin</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">hokyo,</span></em> became Buddhist priests and entered monasteries, there to pass their remaining days, dividing their time between meditation and inspired work that they might leave in dying not only spotless names but imperishable monuments raised to the honor and glory of Japanese art.

A Japanese artist will never of his own accord paint a flower out of season or a spring landscape in autumn; the fitness of things insensibly influences him.  From ancient times certain principles have determined his choice of subjects, according either to the period of the year or to the festivals, ceremonies, entertainments or other events he may be required to commemorate.  All such subjects are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">gwa dai.</span></em>  As one without some knowledge of these cannot appreciate much that is interesting about art customs in Japan, a brief reference to them will be made, beginning with those subjects suitable to the different months of the year:

a god of good luck.  Many meanings are associated with these subjects.  The sun never changes and the ocean is ever changing, hence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in yo</span></em> is symbolized.  The sun, the ocean and the circumambient air symbolize <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten chi jin</span></em> or the universe.  Horai <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(san)</span></em> is a symbol for Japan.  It is the lofty mountain on a fabled island in the distant sea, referred to in early Chinese writings, inhabited by sages <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(sen nin),</span></em> and containing the pine, bamboo and plum (known in art as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sho, chiku, bai),</span></em> the pine standing for longevity, the bamboo for rectitude and the plum blossom for fragrance and grace.  The stork and the tortoise, whose back is covered with seaweed, both typify long life, the ancient saying being that the stork lives for one thousand and the tortoise for ten thousand years <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tsuru wa</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sen nen,</span></em> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kame wa</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">man nen).</span></em>  Fukurokuju is one of the seven gods of good luck, whose name means happiness, wealth and long life.  On New Year's day are suspended on either side of his picture bamboo and plum subjects (<a href="#plate55" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LV</span></a>, 1, 2, 3).

This makes a charming combination.  An excursion into the fields of Chinese philology in connection with the name of this god of good luck would unfold some wonderful word picturing.

An especially appropriate picture for this season of great festivity is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the pine at the gate”</span> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(kado matsu).</span></span>  It commemorates the custom on the first day of the year of planting pine trees at the entrance to Japanese public buildings and private residences.

At the base of the stand is a prawn <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(ebi).</span></span>  This equally suggests old age because the prawn is bent in two.  The leaf of the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">yuzuri</span></span> is introduced because it is an auspicious word and means succession.  The picture of a battledoor and shuttlecock <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(hagoita)</span></span> is also appropriate for New Year as  it commemorates the ancient practice of the Japanese indulging in that pastime on that day (<a href="#plate56" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVI</span></a>, 4).

During January a very popular picture for the alcove <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tokonoma)</span></span> is the treasureship, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">taka-rabune</span></span> (<a href="#plate56" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVI</span></a>, 5). The vessel as it sails into port is heavily laden with all of the various tools
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span>
and utensils typifying great wealth to be found in the capacious bag of Dai Koku, a Japanese god of good luck.  These are a ball, a hammer, weights, cloves, silver bronze, and the god's raincoat and hat.  On the evening of the second of January if the painting of a treasureship be put under the pillow and one dreams of either Fujisan, a falcon or an eggplant, the year long he will be fortunate.  It will be observed that on the sail of the treasure boat is inscribed the Chinese character for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">takara,</span></em> meaning treasure.  On the seventh day of January occurs the first of the five holidays, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">go sekku,</span></span> and vegetable subjects are painted.  These are called the seven grasses <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(hotoke za</span></span> or <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">nana kusa)</span></span> and consist of parsley, shepherd's purse, chickweed, saint's seat, wild turnip and radish.

February—The cock and the hen, with the budding plum branch, are now appropriate.  The subject is known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“plum and chickens”</span> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(ume ni tori)</span></span> (<a href="#plate57" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVII</span></a>, 1).  The chicken figures in the earliest history of Japan.  When the cock crows the Japanese hear the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">kokka koo,</span></em> which, phonetically rendered into Chinese characters, read <span class="tei tei-q">“happiness to our entire land.”</span>  The Chinese hear differently.  To them the cock crows <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">toten ko,</span></em> meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“the eastern heavens are reddening,”</span> so to them the cock heralds the early morn.  Famous paintings of chickens have come from the brushes of Okyo, Tessan (<a href="#plate03" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate III</span></a>), and others of the Maruyama school.  During February, the month of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span>

March—This month is associated with the peach blossom, and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> of gardens containing peach trees, called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">momo no</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">en</span></em> (<a href="#plate57" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVII</span></a>, 4), are in favor.  Toba Saku is related to have lived eight thousand years subsisting upon the fruit of the peach; hence, the peach blossom is a symbol for longevity, and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sake</span></span> made from the fruit is drunk throughout Japan in March.  One of the most famous prose writings in Chinese literature is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ran-tei kioka sui</span></em>.  It commemorates a pastime of the learned, called <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sake</span></span> cup.”</span>  A favorite way of interpreting this subject is to paint a garden of blossoming peach trees and spreading banana palms bordering a flowing stream, with a nobleman attaching to a peach branch a narrow paper <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(tanjaku)</span></em> upon which he has written a poem.  Another famous Chinese prose composition, <span class="tei tei-q">“the peach and apricot garden festival,”</span> written by Ri Tai Haku at the age of fourteen years, is interpreted by depicting Toba Saku in a garden seated before a table, with three Chinese beauties attendant upon him, with celebrated scholars and sages
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span>
circulating midst the flowers and blossoms.  Five principal festivals of the year, known as <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">go sekku,</span></span> occur respectively on the seventh day of January, the third day of March, the fifth day of May, the seventh day of July and the ninth day of September—all being on the odd days of the odd months (the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yo</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in yo).</span></em>  On the third day of the third month is the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">hina matsuri</span></span> festival for young girls, and the appropriate painting for the occasion is called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kami bina,</span></span> meaning paper dolls (<a href="#plate57" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVII</span></a>, 5).  The greatest Japanese artists of the past have vied to make their treatment of this subject superb.  When a female child is born a <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kami bina</span></span> painting is presented to the family to contribute to the festivities.  The month of March is the month of the cherry blossom <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(sakura bana),</span></span> and the picture on <a href="#plate58" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVIII</span></a>, 1, illustrates one method of painting cherry trees ornamenting the mountainside of a canyon, through which flows a river.  During March picnic parties go upon the beach at low tide to gather shell-fish. The subject illustrated on <a href="#plate58" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVIII</span></a>, 2, called ebb-tide <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(shio hi),</span></span> is appropriate.  The picture of the maiden Saohime (<a href="#plate58" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVIII</span></a>, 3) is also painted in March.

April—The wistaria flower <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(Juji)</span></span> is associated with the fourth month and all April landscapes represent the trees covered with much foliage.  A small bird called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sudachi dori,</span></span> hatched in this month, is often painted on the wistaria branch (<a href="#plate58" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVIII</span></a>, 4).

Its long-bladed leaves are sword shaped, therefore the plant symbolizes the warrior spirit <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(bushi).</span></span>  The iris is often planted upon the roof of a house to indicate that there are male children in the family.  The cuckoo and the moon subject <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tsuki ni hototogisu)</span></span> (<a href="#plate58" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LVIII</span></a>, 6) is special to this month.  The fifth of May is the boys' festival, and the carp <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(koi)</span></span> (<a href="#plate59" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LIX</span></a>, 1) is the favorite subject for painting.  May is the rainy month in Japan.  It is related that a carp during this month ascended to the top of the waterfall <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ryu mon</span></em> in China and became a dragon.  The carp thus typifies the triumph of perseverance—the conquering of obstacles—and symbolizes the military spirit.  When this fish is caught and about to be cut up alive for <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sasshimi,</span></span> a Japanese delicacy, once the carver has passed the flat side of the knife blade over the body of the fish the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">koi</span></span> becomes motionless, and with heroic fortitude submits to being sliced to the backbone.  Served in a dish, a few drops of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">soy</span></span> being placed in its eye it leaps upward in a last struggle, to fall apart in many pieces.  When a male child is born a proper present to the family is a carp <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono.</span></span>  The fifth day of the fifth month is the anniversary of the great victory of the Japanese over Kublai Khan, who, with an enormous fleet of Chinese vessels, attempted to invade Japan in the thirteenth century.

All pictures painted during the month of June should suggest shady, refreshing sensations.  A charming and favorite subject is water flowing through an open bamboo pipe and falling amid luxuriant vegetation into a pool below, where a little bird is bathing.

July—During this month appropriate among flower subjects is that of the seven grasses of autumn <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(aki no nana kusa)</span></span> (<a href="#plate59" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LIX</span></a>, 6), consisting of the bush clover, the wild pink, the morning glory, et cetera.  This is most difficult to paint on account of the extreme delicacy requisite in the handling of the brush, but a skilful artist can produce most interesting effects.  All sorts of wonderfully shaped insects as well as birds of brilliant plumage are permitted in the picture.  The seventh day of July is known as the festival of the stars, and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Kengyu,</span></span> the swain, and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Orihime,</span></span> the maiden, are painted.

August—The first grain of the year is now offered to the gods.  A charming way of commemorating this is by the painting called stacked rice and sparrows <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(inamura ni suzume)</span></span> (<a href="#plate60" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LX</span></a>, 1).

As mist abounds during August, landscapes half concealed in mist are painted.  The Kano artist, Tanyu, leaned much to such scenes, which suggest the tranquility of eventide.

September—The ninth day of the ninth month is the festival of the chrysanthemum <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(kiku no sekku),</span></em> when <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sake</span></span> made from the chrysanthemum is drunk.  Kiku Jido, a court youth, having inadvertently touched with his foot the pillow of the emperor, was banished to a distant isle where, it is said, he was nourished by the dew of the chrysanthemum which abounded there.  Becoming a hermit, he lived one thousand years.  Seasonal pictures for this month commemorate this event, or reproduce the yellow and white chrysanthemum.  (<a href="#plate61" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXI</span></a>, 1).

Tatsuta hime (<a href="#plate61" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXI</span></a>, 2) is also painted.  She is the autumn divinity, associated with the brilliant, warm and resplendent colors of the autumn season,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span>

Pictures of the deer and the early maples <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(hatsu momiji ni shika)</span></span> (<a href="#plate61" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXI</span></a>, 3) are now appropriate.

November—A month sacred to Evesco, one of the jovial gods of good luck (<a href="#plate62" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXII</span></a>, 3).  He was the first trader, his stock being the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tai</span></em> fish.  He is the favorite god of the merchants who, during this month, celebrate his festival.  Evesama is usually represented returning from fishing with a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tai</span></em> under his arm.  The Kano artists particularly favored this subject.  Another charming picture, known as <span class="tei tei-q">“the last of the chrysanthemums”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(zan kiku)</span></em> (<a href="#plate62" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXII</span></a>, 4), suggests the approaching close of the year. The classic way to represent this subject
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span>
is with small, yellow chrysanthemums clinging to a straggling bamboo fence, with a few of their leaves which have begun to turn crimson.  Another November picture is <span class="tei tei-q">“the first snow”</span> <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(hatsu yuki)</span></span> (<a href="#plate62" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXII</span></a>, 5).  Two puppies are frollicking in the snow, which is falling for the first time.  It is said that no animal rejoices like the dog when it sees the first snowfall of winter.  Snow, says a proverb, is the dog's grandmother <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(yuki wa inu no obasan).</span></span>  Okyo and Hokusai frequently painted this subject.  <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Hatsu yuki</span></span> is sometimes represented by a little snow upon the pine tree or the bamboo in a landscape.  This produces a very lonely <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(samushii)</span></span> scene.  The Kyoto artists are extremely fond of painting in the month of November the subject of a peasant girl descending from the mountain village of Ohara carrying upon her head a bundle of firewood twigs, into which she has coquettishly inserted a branch of red maple leaves.     This picture is called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">Oharame</span></span> (<a href="#plate62" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXII</span></a>, 6).  Landscapes representing fitful rain showers are appropriate for November and are called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">shigure.</span></span>  This is the month for the <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">oshi dori</span></span> (<a href="#plate63" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXIII</span></a>, 1).  These mandarin ducks, male and female, on account of the contrast in their shape and plumage, make a very striking and favorite picture.  Their devotion to each other is so great that they die if separated.  Hence, such paintings not only symbolize conjugal fidelity but are also appropriate as wedding presents.  There are two other kinds of birds painted in November: The beach birds, known as <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">chi dori</span></span> (<a href="#plate63" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXIII</span></a>, 2), and the wild duck flying over the marsh grasses <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(kamo ni ashi)</span></span> (<a href="#plate63" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXIII</span></a>, 3).

Shaka's death is commemorated in the picture called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">nehan,</span></em> nirvana.  The lord, Buddha, is stretched upon a bier tranquilly dying, an angelic smile lighting his countenance, while around are gathered his disciples, Rakkan and Bosatsu, and the different animals of creation, all weeping.  A rat having gone to call Mayabunin, mother of Buddha, has been pounced upon by a cat and torn to pieces.  For this reason in paintings of this moving scene of Shaka's death no cat is to be found among the mourning animals.  The artist Cho Densu, however, in his great painting of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">nehan</span></em> (still preserved in the Temple To Fuku Ji at Kyoto) introduces the portrait of a cat.  It is related that, while Cho Densu was painting, the cat came daily to his side and continually mewing and expressing its grief, would not leave him.  Finally Cho Densu, out of pity, painted the cat into the picture and thereupon the animal out of joy fell over dead.

Mats are three by six feet in size and must always be so laid as not to form crosses, which are unlucky.  In the alcove of this room no <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> is permitted but one in the pure Japanese style.  The subject of the painting will depend upon the season, while all red colors are proscribed and <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">sumi</span></span> pictures of the Kano school are most appropriate.  The treatment must be simple <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(tan paku)</span></em>; for instance, a single flower spray, a branch of the plum, a hermit, or a solitary mountain peak.  In the ceremony of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sen cha</span></em> (<a href="#plate66" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Plate LXVI</span></a>, 2), which is the Chinese way of making tea, these strict rules of <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">cha no yu</span></span> are relaxed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are many books upon the subject of signing and authenticating a painting.  Two well-known works are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">“</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gwa Jo Yo Ryaku</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">”</span></span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">“</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dai Ga Shi San.</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">”</span></span></em>  In China literary men often add descriptive matter to their paintings, writing prominently thereon: <span class="tei tei-q">“In a dream last night I witnessed the scene I here attempt to reproduce,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“On a boating excursion we saw this pine tree shading the banks of the river.”</span>  Such additions to the picture enable the artist to exhibit his skill as an expert writer and are considered to heighten the general effect.  Often original poetry takes the place of prose.  The year, month and day will be added, followed by the signature of the writer, with some self-depreciatory term, such as <span class="tei tei-q">“fisherman of the North Sea,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“mountain wood-chopper”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“hermit dwelling amid the clouds and rocks.”</span>  Such signature, with one or more seals scattered over the face of the work, is in art called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">rakkwan,</span></em> signifying <span class="tei tei-q">“completed.”</span>
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Japan a somewhat different way of signing prevails. The artist's signature with his seal under it is appended to the painting, not in a conspicuous but in the least prominent part of it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Painters of the Tosa, Fujiwara, Sumiyoshi and Kasuga schools in signing their work first wrote above their signatures their office and rank, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">e. g.,</span></span> Unemi no Kami or Shikibu Gondai no Kami in the square or round Chinese characters.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Kano artists signed their names in round characters <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(gyo sho)</span></em> and did not add their secular rank or office but wrote before their signatures their Buddhist titles; thus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hogan</span></em> Motonobu, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ho Kyo</span></em> Naganobu, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hoin</span></em> Tsunenobu.  In the Maruyama period all titles and rank were omitted and simply the name <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(namae)</span></span> or the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">nom de plume</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(go)</span></em> was written,—thus, Okyo, Goshun, Tessan, Bun Cho—strict attention being paid, however, to executing the Chinese characters for such signatures in both an artistic and strikingly attractive way, whether written in one or another of the three usual forms technically called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">shin, so, gyo.</span></em>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The date, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">nen go,</span></em> preceding the signature upon a painting is often indicated by the use of one of the twelve horary characters <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ju ni shi)</span></em> along with one of the ten calendar signs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(ju ran).</span></em>  These, in orderly arrangement, comprehend a cycle of sixty years; in other words, they are never united the same way or coincide but once during that period.  No artist under sixty should, in signing his work, allude to his age, much less state his years.  For him to be able to write seventy-seven before his name is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span>
most auspicious—one way of writing <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kotobuki,</span></span> the luckiest word in Japanese, being to employ two
sevens which, thus compounded, is said to be the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">so sho</span></em> character for that word.  Very young persons are permitted in signing their paintings or writings to add their exact ages up to thirteen.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where Chinese literary artists add poems to their paintings as many as eight seals may be observed thereon.  In Japanese paintings never more than two seals are used and these follow and authenticate the signature.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The correct distance at which a <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kakemono</span></span> is to be viewed is the width of a mat <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(tatami)</span></span> from the alcove where the picture is hung.  It is bad form to look at it standing.  Before critically examining the work a Japanese will scrutinize the artist's signature and seal.  It is a cardinal rule in Japan that the signature be affixed so as not to interfere with the scheme of the picture or attract the eye.  If the picture looks to the right the signature and seal should be placed on the left, and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa;</span></span> if the principal interest is in the upper part of a picture these should be placed lower down, and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa.</span></span>  As every painting has its division into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yo</span></em> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">rakkwan</span></em> is placed in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in.</span></em>  Some artists partially cover their signatures with their seal impression.  Lady artists add to their signatures the character <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">jo</span></em>, meaning woman.  Veteran painters will sometimes write before their signatures the character for old man <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(okina).</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The artist's seal is often a work of art and his family name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(myoji)</span></em> or his artist name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(go)</span></em> is usually
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span>
engraved thereon with the Chinese seal characters called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten sho.</span></em> Where two seals are affixed
below the signature one may contain a classic aphorism, like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">tai bi fu gen</span></em> (the truly beautiful is indescribable) or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">chu yo</span></em> (keep the middle path).  Before seals were used writings were authenticated by scrolls called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">kaki</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">han.</span></em>  Even now such scrolls are used.  The principles on which they are shaped are derived from astrological lore <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(eki).</span></em>  Seal engravers deservedly enjoy renown for learning and skill.  To carve a seal is the recognized accomplishment of a gentleman, and the most famous living seal engraver in Japan is an amateur.  Seals are of jade, rock crystal, precious woods, Formosa bamboo root, gold, silver or ivory.  The best hard stone for seals comes from China and is known as the cock's comb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(kei ketsu seki).</span></em>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An artist during his career will collect numbers of valuable seals for his own use.  These at his death may be given to favorite pupils or kept as house treasures.  Bairei left instructions to have many of his seals destroyed.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seal paste <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(niku)</span></em> is made of Diana weed <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">(mogusa)</span></span> dried for three years, or of a plant called <span lang="jp" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="jp"><span style="font-style: italic">yomogi,</span></span> or with soft, finely chopped rabbit hair boiled in castor oil for one hundred hours with white wax and then colored red, brown, blue or tea color.  The seal should be carefully wiped after it is used, otherwise this paste hardens upon it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Japanese paintings are seldom framed, as frames take too much room.  Frames are used chiefly for Chinese writings, hung high in public places or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span>
about the dwelling, and are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">gaku,</span></em> meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“forehead,”</span> in allusion to raising the head to read what the frame contains.  It is etiquette that such framed writings be signed with the real name rather than the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">nom de plume.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two kinds of seals are affixed to the frame: One, on the right, at the beginning of the writing, and called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yu in,</span></em> containing some precept or maxim; and one or two, on the left, after the signature, bearing the artist's name and any other appropriate designation.  All writings in Chinese or Japanese read from right to left, and frequently are the sole ornament of a pair of screens.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the guidance of experts who pass on the genuineness of Japanese paintings there is a well-known publication, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gwa Ka Rakkwan In Shin,</span></em>”</span> by Kano Jushin, which contains reproductions in fac simile of the signatures and seals of all the celebrated artists of the remote and recent past.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In concluding this work, which I am conscious is but an imperfect survey of a vast and intricate subject, I would call attention to the fact that in both Europe and America there is a wonderful awakening to the dignity, simplicity and beauty of Japanese art.  This is largely to be attributed to the careful and scholarly writings and publications of Messrs. Anderson, Binyon, Morrison and Strange in England, Fenollosa in the United states, DeGoncourt, Gonse and Bing in France, Seidlitz in Germany, and Brinkley and Okakura in Japan; and all students of art must render to them the homage of their sincere admiration.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The object of all art, as Cicero has truly said, is to soften the manners, by training the heart and mind to right thoughts and worthy sentiments.  To such end nothing will more surely contribute than a faithful study of the painting art of Japan, and the further we investigate and appreciate its principles the more we will multiply those hours which the sun-dial registers,—the serene and cheerful moments of existence.
